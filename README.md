# DijkstraOnMaps

Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path on a map.

## Project Details

Maps - Map is taken/exported from OpenStreetMap while is a free and open service to use.  
       The file exported is in .osm format which is used in the program.
       
Algorithm - For Shortest Path we are using Dijkstra's Algorithm.  
            The connection between nodes are stored in a Nodes x Nodes adjacency Matrix.

## Files

There are 2 files:
 - .py File can be compiled and run using ide.
 - .ipynb File open it in jupyter or colab and then compile all the cells.

## Functioning

When Compiled the map is analysed and all the nodes are stored in a list.  
Then an adjacency matrix of node x node is generated and mapped.  
In this at first all the nodes are assumed start point and a path to other nodes are generated.  


Then we ask user for the source node using a map automatically opened in a browser.

(Nodes are in green dots)  


After that a multiple destination nodes are displayed to the user in the browser.

(Blue dot is the source and red dots are the possible destination)  


After the user selects a destination, the shortest path is displayed in the map.

The whole process is running in the console when the .py file is compiled.
